# ServiceB aka Google

 * examples are based on work in progress modeling Google Search Gallery validation rules in ShEx (and SHACL).
 * don't read too much into anything you see here, it's all experimental and shouldn't be taken as formal rules from Google.
 * the vision is that other services will be able to do the same, in their repos or here, so that the validator shows a more 
comprehensive view of the landscape.
